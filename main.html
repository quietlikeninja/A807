	<p>Alpha Company 807 is a group of friendly guardians dedicated to Destiny. We play to have fun and usually succeed!</p>
      	<p>Here's a quick guide to get you all set up with the group!</p>
      	<ol>
		<li><a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Clan/1424345">Join the Alpha Company 807 clan, the Knackered Assassins, on Bungie.net. </a>This will display our clan name on your in-game emblem, you will be able to receive clan-related achievements and you'll be able to see online clanmates in your Destiny roster page.</li>
      		<li><a href="https://www.the100.io/gaming_sessions/new?group_id=995">Post or join a gaming session.</a> It can be for story missions, crucible, raids, whatever it is you like to do! Don't forget to mark it as "Group Only" if you don't want randoms to join.</li>
		<li>Don't be shy. Experience tells us that people who join the group but don't participate in chat or join sessions don't last long before disappearing again. We want you to enjoy our company, and the easiest way to do that is to jump in and join a session. Once your name is known, you'll find people very willing to help you with whatever it is you need in the game.</li>
		<li>If you want to try something new (or hard) but would like a more experienced player to help you through it, you can use the "Sherpa Requested" checkbox. Please note that this marks your session as public, so people from outside the 807 will be able to join it.</li>
		<li>We're all here for fun. Be nice. <i>(don't be a dick!)</i></li>
		<li>If you're running late or need to miss a game you signed up for, message the group using @mentions in the session chat. You can get the attention of a member with the gamertag JohnSmith by using @JohnSmith in chat (Spaces in gamertags need to be replaced with underscores). You can also use @all to message everyone in the session at the same time.</li>
		<li>Please leave your sessions flagged as "Group Only" until at least 2 hours before your game starts. This promotes playing with a consistent group of people and members of the 807.</li>
      		<li><strong>Most importantly</strong>, don't forget to have fun!</li>
	</ol>

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Knackered Assassins is now on Discord!</strong>
<p>To allow more diversity in chat, we have set up a Discord Server for the group. Please join us over there. A link to the server is contained under the Useful Links button above.</p>
<p>For those unaware of Discord, it is an app/website that allows multiple chat channels. It will also host voice chat for our Destiny 2 PC players when that time rolls around. Discord can be downloaded as an app on iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>Of course, A807 members are welcome to continue to chat on the100.io if they wish! Testing a change.

<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Clan Membership</strong>
<p>With the coming release of Destiny 2, the time is fast approaching when we'll need to do a review of membership of the group's clan the Knackered Assassins.</p>
<p>The goal of that review will be to make space for new members.</p>
<p>The mods are aware that there are guardians in the clan who are active in-game but not in chat or on the100.io. We will of course take that into consideration</p>
<p>If you have any questions in relation to membership or your activity, please send a message to the clan's moderators on bungie.net</p>
<p>PS. The moderators of the clan are NOT the same as the moderators of the 807. Please check before sending your message.</p>
