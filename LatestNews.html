	<p>Alpha Company 807 is a group of friendly guardians dedicated to Destiny. We play to have fun and usually succeed!</p>
      	<p>Here's a quick guide to get you all set up with the group!</p>
      	<ol>
		<li>Join one or more of our clans, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Clan/1424345">Knackered Assassins</a> or <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2?groupid=2047275">Knackered Assassins Prime</a> on bungie.net. It's up to you which clan you choose, but we recommend Knackered Assassins for Xbox players and Knackered Assassins Prime for PlayStation and PC players. Joining a clain will display our clan name on your in-game emblem, you will be able to receive clan-related achievements, trophies and rewards and you'll be able to see online clanmates in your Destiny roster page.</li>
      		<li><a href="https://discord.gg/XcqC6WF">Join our Discord channel</a> for the best chat experience.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.the100.io/gaming_sessions/new?group_id=995">Post or join a gaming session.</a> It can be for story missions, crucible, raids, whatever it is you like to do! Don't forget to mark it as "Group Only" if you don't want randoms to join.</li>
		<li>Don't be shy. Experience tells us that people who join the group but don't participate in chat or join sessions don't last long before disappearing again. We want you to enjoy our company, and the easiest way to do that is to jump in and join a session. Once your name is known, you'll find people very willing to help you with whatever it is you need in the game.</li>
		<li>If you want to try something new (or hard) but would like a more experienced player to help you through it, you can use the "Sherpa Requested" checkbox. Please note that this marks your session as public, so people from outside the 807 will be able to join it.</li>
		<li>We're all here for fun. Be nice. <i>(don't be a dick!)</i></li>
		<li>If you're running late or need to miss a game you signed up for, message the group using @mentions in the session chat. You can get the attention of a member with the gamertag JohnSmith by using @JohnSmith in chat (Spaces in gamertags need to be replaced with underscores). You can also use @all to message everyone in the session at the same time.</li>
		<li>Please leave your sessions flagged as "Group Only" until at least 2 hours before your game starts. This promotes playing with a consistent group of people and members of the 807.</li>
      		<li><strong>Most importantly</strong>, don't forget to have fun!</li>
	</ol>

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Knackered Assassins is now on Discord!</strong>
<p>To allow more diversity in chat, we have set up a Discord Server for the group. Please join us over there. A link to the server is contained under the Useful Links button above.</p>
<p>For those unaware of Discord, it is an app/website that allows multiple chat channels. It will also host voice chat for our Destiny 2 PC players when that time rolls around. Discord can be downloaded as an app on iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>Of course, A807 members are welcome to continue to chat on the100.io if they wish!

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Iron Banner is back!</strong>
<p>For the newer guardians among us, Alpha Company 807 tends to go a little PvP mad when Iron Banner rolls around. You'll see more PvP sessions but you'll also likely see them all full.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have a "pop in and see" rule. If you've joined up to a session as a reserve and don't get an invite to it (or even if you haven't signed up), feel free to pop into the Xbox Live party and see who's there. If the group is full, they'll know to keep you in mind when someone inevitably drops out. They might even send you in the direction of another 807 fireteam who aren't full.</p>
<p>We also recommend that you join the group's bungie.net clan The Knackered Assassins. That way you'll be able to see us all in your Destiny roster page, and can freely implement the "pop in and see" rule.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing everyone in the crucible!</p>
