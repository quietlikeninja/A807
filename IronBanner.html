<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Iron Banner is back!</strong>
    <p>For the newer guardians among us, Alpha Company 807 tends to go a little PvP mad when Iron Banner rolls around. You'll see more PvP sessions but you'll also likely see them all full.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, we have a "pop in and see" rule. If you've joined up to a session as a reserve and don't get an invite to it (or even if you haven't signed up), feel free to pop into the Xbox Live party and see who's there. If the group is full, they'll know to keep you in mind when someone inevitably drops out. They might even send you in the direction of another 807 fireteam who aren't full.</p>
    <p>We also recommend that you join the group's bungie.net clan The Knackered Assassins. That way you'll be able to see us all in your Destiny roster page, and can freely implement the "pop in and see" rule.</p>
    <p>We look forward to seeing everyone in the crucible!</p>
